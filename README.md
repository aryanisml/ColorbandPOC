= means that weâ€™re using a two-way data binding. This means that if you update that variable in your component scope, the change will be reflected on the parent scope;
< is for one-way bindings when we just want to read a value from a parent scope and not update it;
@ is for string parameters;
& is for callbacks in case your component needs to output something to its parent scope.
